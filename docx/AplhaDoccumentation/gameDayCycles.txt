60*60 = 3600 frames in 1 min

60*240 = 14400 frames in 4 min

60* 100= 6000 frames in 1 min 40 seconds

1 min 40 seconds day 20 seconds for sunset
1 min 40 seconds night 20 seconds for sunrise


spawning 2 clouds from either side moving to either other side (aprox 1200 pixels) depends on width of cloud
would take 20 seconds if the clouds moved at 1 pixel per frame

40 seconds if the clouds moved at .5 pixels per frame
